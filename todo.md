### todo:

now:

- finish CRUD FE for announcements/events/resources
- bug when

later:

- refactor common code in announcementService, eventService, and resourceService into one parent class, if possible
- create dto for getAnnouncementList/getEventList so you can say if there's any left for vInfiniteScroll
- figure out images with Azure blog storage or on web server
