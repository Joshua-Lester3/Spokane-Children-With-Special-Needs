### todo:

now:
- tabs on home page for home/resources
- 

later:
- refactor common code in announcementService, eventService, and resourceService into one parent class, if possible
- create dto for getAnnouncementList/getEventList so you can say if there's any left for vInfiniteScroll
- figure out images with Azure blog storage or on web server
