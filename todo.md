### todo:

now:

-
- admin endpoints for creating moderators
- admin FE for creating moderators and viewing them
- key vault for admin/jwt secret
- images from blob storage
- static web app/api cloud infrastructure :)

later:

- refactor common code in announcementService, eventService, and resourceService into one parent class, if possible
- create dto for getAnnouncementList/getEventList so you can say if there's any left for vInfiniteScroll
- figure out images with Azure blog storage or on web server
