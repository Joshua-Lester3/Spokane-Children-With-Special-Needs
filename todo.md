### todo:

now:

-
- key vault for admin/jwt secret
- static web app/api cloud infrastructure :)
- images from blob storage (later, focus on previous first)

later:

- change resource type to be stored in database to allow for mods to edit them if needed :)
- resource page loads very slowly in google developer mode. Find out why
- refactor common code in announcementService, eventService, and resourceService into one parent class, if possible
- create dto for getAnnouncementList/getEventList so you can say if there's any left for vInfiniteScroll
- figure out images with Azure blob storage
